# DDOLib-Scala

Scala API for [DDOLib](https://github.com/DDOLIB-CETIC-UCL/DDOLib) library.

[DDOLib](https://github.com/DDOLIB-CETIC-UCL/DDOLib) is a open-source (MIT) java solver for solving dynamic
programming (DP) problems developped
by the [CETIC](https://www.cetic.be/) (team of [Renaud De Landtsheer](https://www.cetic.be/Renaud-DE-LANDTSHEER)) and
the [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) (team of [Pierre Schaus](https://pschaus.github.io/)).
It includes a modeling API for users to define their DP problem and solve them efficiently.

# Theoretical Foundations

The technique of using decision diagrams for solving combinatorial problems is based on the work of several researchers.

The first paper that introduced the concept of using decision diagrams for combinatorial optimization is:

*Bergman, D., Cire, A. A., Van Hoeve, W. J., & Hooker, J. N. (2016). Discrete optimization with decision diagrams.
INFORMS Journal on Computing.*

Then the technique was improved in several papers that are also implemented in this project or will eventually be:

* *Coppé, V., Gillard, X., & Schaus, P. (2024). Decision diagram-based branch-and-bound with caching for
  dominance and suboptimality detection. INFORMS Journal on Computing.*
* *Coppé, V., Gillard, X., & Schaus, P. (2024). Modeling and Exploiting Dominance Rules for Discrete Optimization with
  Decision Diagrams. CPAIOR.*
* *Gillard, X., & Schaus, P. (2022). Large Neighborhood Search with Decision Diagrams. In IJCAI.*
* *Gillard, X., Coppé, V., Schaus, P., & Cire, A. A. (2021). Improving the filtering of branch-and-bound MDD solver.
  CPAIOR*
* *Gillard, X., Schaus, P., & Coppé, V. (2014). Ddo, a generic and efficient framework for mdd-based optimization.
  IJCAI.*

# At the origin: The DDO Project

DDOLib is a Java version of DDO, which was originally implemented in Rust and is
available [here](https://github.com/xgillard/ddo).

## Examples

<!--
The project contains two sets of example models located in the [examples](./src/main/java/org/ddolib/ddo/examples/)
package.

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items while
staying within a given weight limit. The dynamic programming model used to solve this problem uses the recurrence
relation:

`KS(i, c) = max(KS(i-1, c), KS(i-1, c - w[i]) + p[i])`

where `KS(i, c)` is the maximum value of the first `i` items with a knapsack capacity of `c`,
`p[i]` is the profit of item `i`, and `w[i]` is the weight of item `i`.

For modeling this problem in DDOLib, we define the `KSProblem` class that implements the `Problem` interface.
This interface requires to define a state. This state is the remaining capacity of the knapsack (an Integer).
We also define the `initialState` method to return the initial capacity of the knapsack, and the `initialValue` method
to return 0 as the initial value of the knapsack.
The `nbVars` method returns the number of items, which is the same as the number of variables in the problem.
The `domain` method defines the possible decisions for each item (take or not take), and the `transition` method updates
the state of the knapsack based on the decision made.
The `transitionCost` method returns the profit of the item if it is taken, and 0 otherwise.
This implicitely define a decision diagram where the optimal solution is the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

```java
/**
 * The state is the remaining capacity of the knapsack (an Integer thus).
 * The decision is the item to take or not (1 or 0).
 */
public class KSProblem implements Problem<Integer> {

    final int capa;
    final int[] profit;
    final int[] weight;
    public final Integer optimal;

    public KSProblem(final int capa, final int[] profit, final int[] weight, final Integer optimal) {
        this.capa = capa;
        this.profit = profit;
        this.weight = weight;
        this.optimal = optimal;
    }

    @Override
    public int nbVars() {
        return profit.length;
    }

    @Override
    public Integer initialState() {
        return capa;
    }

    @Override
    public int initialValue() {
        return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Integer> domain(Integer state, int var) {
        if (state >= weight[var]) { // The item can be taken or not
            return Arrays.asList(1, 0).iterator();
        } else { // The item cannot be taken
            return List.of(0).iterator();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Integer transition(Integer state, Decision decision) {
        // If the item is taken (1), we decrease the capacity of the knapsack, otherwise leave it unchanged
        return state - weight[decision.var()] * decision.val();
    }

    @Override
    public int transitionCost(Integer state, Decision decision) {
        // If the item is taken (1) the cost is the profit of the item, 0 otherwise
        return profit[decision.var()] * decision.val();
    }
}
```
