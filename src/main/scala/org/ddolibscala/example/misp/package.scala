/** This package implements the acs, astar and ddo models for the Maximum Independent Set Problem
  * (MISP).
  *
  * <p> Given a weighted graph 𝐺 = (𝑉,𝐸,𝑤) where 𝑉= {1,...,𝑛} is a set of vertices, 𝐸 \subset
  * 𝑉 ×𝑉 the set of edges connecting those vertices and 𝑤 = {𝑤1,𝑤2,...,𝑤𝑛} is a set of
  * weights s.t. 𝑤𝑖 is the weight of node 𝑖. The problem consists in finding a subset of vertices
  * in a graph such that no edge exists in the graph that connects two of the selected nodes and the
  * sum of the weight of the selected nodes is maximal. </p>
